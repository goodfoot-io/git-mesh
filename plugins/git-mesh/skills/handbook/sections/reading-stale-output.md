# Reading `git mesh stale` output

`git mesh stale` asks: *do the anchored bytes still match reality?* It prints one finding per anchor per drifting layer, plus pending entries for any staged mesh ops.

## Status values

- **`FRESH`** — Current bytes equal anchored bytes at the same location. No action.
- **`MOVED`** — Bytes are equal, but path or line numbers changed. Usually keep; re-anchor only if the new location is the one the mesh should point at.
- **`CHANGED`** — Current bytes differ, or the anchor was deleted. Review the relationship, then update code or mesh.
- **`ORPHANED`** / **`MERGE_CONFLICT`** / **`SUBMODULE`** / **`CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE(...)`** — Terminal. Read `./terminal-statuses.md` or `./content-unavailable.md`.

## Layers and the `src` column

The resolver checks up to four layers, shallowing order: HEAD → Index → Worktree → staged mesh ops. Each drifting layer produces its own finding.

- **`src=H`** — Drift is already in HEAD (committed).
- **`src=I`** — Drift is in the index (staged with `git add`) but not HEAD.
- **`src=W`** — Drift is in the worktree (unstaged edit on disk).
- **Staged mesh ops** render in a trailing section, not in the main finding list.

The same anchor can appear twice when two layers both differ — e.g. a file with one edit `git add`-ed (src=I) and another edit left unstaged (src=W). That's the layering doing its job, not a duplicate.

Peel layers with subtractive flags:
- `--no-worktree` drops W findings.
- `--no-index` drops I findings.
- `--no-staged-mesh` drops the staged-ops section.
- HEAD is always on — no flag turns it off.

## `(ack)` — acknowledgment

A finding prints `(ack)` when a staged `git mesh add` covers it. Staging an `add` after seeing drift captures current bytes as a sidecar; the resolver treats that as "I've seen this, the update is queued" — the finding still prints, but exit code is not driven by it. The moment live content drifts from the sidecar again, the acknowledgment is invalidated.

Only mesh-layer actions acknowledge mesh drift. `git add` and `git commit` move file drift between layers; they do not silence findings.

## Exit code

Non-zero if any of:
- A finding has drift at HEAD / Index / Worktree with no matching staged re-anchor.
- A terminal status (`ORPHANED`, `MERGE_CONFLICT`, `SUBMODULE`, `CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE`) isn't suppressed.
- A staged `add`/`remove` op has a sidecar whose bytes disagree with the blob it anchors.
- A positional `<target>` names a referent that doesn't exist (missing file, missing mesh name, unmatched literal glob). Stderr in that case is `git mesh stale: file not found: '<target>'`.

`--no-exit-code` forces exit 0 regardless of findings. `--ignore-unavailable` downgrades `CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE` only.

## No-news-is-good-news

`git mesh stale` is silent on the clean path. A fully-fresh mesh produces no per-mesh header, no anchor list, no why — output is empty and exit code is 0. This applies to every form: the no-args sweep, a named mesh (`git mesh stale <name>`), and a path arg (`git mesh stale src/auth.ts`). To force a full listing of a mesh's anchors regardless of staleness, use `git mesh <name>` instead of `stale`.

A target that resolves to zero meshes — for example `git mesh stale notes/readme.md` against a path no mesh tracks — also exits 0 silently. Only a missing referent (see above) drives a non-zero exit on the resolution path.

## Machine formats

```bash
git mesh stale --format=porcelain
git mesh stale --format=json
git mesh stale --format=junit
git mesh stale --format=github-actions
```

### JSON schema (schema_version: 2)

Top-level: `{ "schema_version": 2, "findings": [...], "staged_ops": [...] }`.

Each finding carries:
- `status.code` — `"FRESH"`, `"CHANGED"`, `"MOVED"`, `"ORPHANED"`, `"MERGE_CONFLICT"`, `"SUBMODULE"`, `"CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE"`, `"SidecarTampered"`
- `status.detail` — empty for `FRESH`/`MERGE_CONFLICT`; reason tag for `CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE` (e.g. `"LfsNotFetched"`); tamper detail for `SidecarTampered`
- `anchor.kind` — `"lines"` or `"whole"`
- `anchor.path`, `anchor.line_start`, `anchor.line_end` (null for whole-file)
- `current.blob` — the live blob OID, or `null` when the file is deleted
- `current.path`, `current.line_start`, `current.line_end` — live location (may differ from anchor for `MOVED`)
- `moved_to` — present only for `MOVED`; null for all other statuses
- `source` — `"(index)"`, `"(worktree)"`, `"(staged)"`, or absent for HEAD

`current.blob: null` with `status.code: "CHANGED"` means the file was deleted — the same condition that text output renders as `MOVED` with an arrow. See § "Text vs JSON disagreements" below.

`CONTENT_UNAVAILABLE` findings carry a `status.detail` with the reason tag.

### Text vs JSON disagreements

The text renderer and JSON encoder do not always agree on status codes for the same anchor. The most common discrepancy:

- **Text output shows `MOVED` (arrow)** — per-mesh `git mesh stale <name>` prints a `→` arrow when bytes match at a new location.
- **JSON output shows `"code": "CHANGED"` with `moved_to: null`** — the full-sweep JSON encodes the same condition differently.

When scripting against stale output, pick one format and test against it. Do not mix text and JSON interpretations in the same workflow. The JSON schema is the canonical encoding; the text renderer optimizes for human skimmability.

## Hook injections vs. CLI stale output

The PostToolUse hook in `plugins/git-mesh/hooks/hooks.json` does **not** call `git mesh stale`. It calls `git mesh advice <sid> read|touch|flush`, whose render shape and marker set are different. See `./understanding-hook-output.md` for the advice render. Notable differences when reading text in `additionalContext` / `systemMessage`:

- Header line: `<active-anchor> is in the <mesh> mesh with:` (advice) vs. per-mesh status header (`stale`).
- Status clauses appear in **parentheses** in advice (`(CHANGED)`, `(MOVED)`, `(ORPHANED)`, `(CONFLICT)`, `(SUBMODULE)`, `(DELETED)`, `(RENAMED)`); `stale` uses **square brackets** (`[CHANGED]`, `[MOVED]`) plus `FRESH`, `(ack)`, and `src=…` annotations that advice does not emit.
- Advice may include an excerpt block of related anchor bytes and a one-line `git mesh …` next-step command; `stale` never does.

If text in `additionalContext` carries `(ack)` or `src=…`, something other than the standard hook produced it.
